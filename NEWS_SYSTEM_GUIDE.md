# News System - Point-in-Time Events

## 📰 **New News System Overview**

The news system has been completely redesigned to handle **point-in-time events** rather than intervals, with sophisticated template-based scheduling.

## 🏗️ **Architecture**

### **News Templates**
Reusable definitions for news types with:
- **Name**: Event type (e.g., "Non-Farm Payrolls", "FOMC Rate Decision")
- **Countdown Period**: How long before the event to start showing countdown
- **Cooldown Period**: How long after the event to keep showing it
- **Impact Level**: Low, Medium, High
- **Currency**: Related currency (USD, EUR, etc.)

### **News Instances** 
Specific scheduled occurrences of templates:
- **Scheduled Time**: Exact date and time of the news event
- **Custom Overrides**: Can override name, impact, currency from template
- **Active Status**: Can be enabled/disabled
- **Unique Instances**: Multiple instances of same template allowed

## 🎯 **Key Features**

### **1. Template-Based System**
```typescript
// Pre-defined templates include:
- Non-Farm Payrolls (30min countdown, 15min cooldown, HIGH impact, USD)
- FOMC Rate Decision (60min countdown, 30min cooldown, HIGH impact, USD)  
- Consumer Price Index (30min countdown, 20min cooldown, HIGH impact, USD)
- GDP Report (30min countdown, 15min cooldown, MEDIUM impact, USD)
- Retail Sales (15min countdown, 10min cooldown, MEDIUM impact, USD)
- ECB Rate Decision (60min countdown, 30min cooldown, HIGH impact, EUR)
```

### **2. Smart Countdown Phases**
- **Countdown Phase**: Before event starts (countdown display)
- **Happening Phase**: Event is occurring (within 1 minute)  
- **Cooldown Phase**: After event (impact still relevant)

### **3. Settings UI**
- **Dropdown Selection**: Choose from predefined news templates
- **Date/Time Picker**: Schedule for specific date and time
- **Custom Overrides**: Modify name, impact level, currency
- **Instance Management**: View, edit, enable/disable scheduled events
- **Validation**: Ensures events are scheduled in future with valid data

## 🚀 **Usage Workflow**

### **Step 1: Access News Settings**
1. Click Settings button in header
2. Navigate to "News" tab
3. See template dropdown and instance management

### **Step 2: Create News Instance**  
1. Select news type from dropdown (e.g., "Non-Farm Payrolls")
2. Choose date and time for the event
3. Optionally customize name, impact, currency
4. Click "Create News Event"

### **Step 3: Manage Instances**
1. View all scheduled events in chronological order
2. See countdown timers for upcoming events
3. Toggle events active/inactive
4. Delete unwanted instances
5. Past events automatically marked

### **Step 4: Monitor Dashboard**
1. Active news events appear in main dashboard
2. Different visual phases (countdown/happening/cooldown)
3. Impact-based color coding (red=high, orange=medium, yellow=low)
4. News events show distinct from interval events

## 📊 **Visual Indicators**

### **Impact Levels**
- **🔴 High Impact**: Red colors, longer countdown/cooldown
- **🟠 Medium Impact**: Orange colors, moderate periods  
- **🟡 Low Impact**: Yellow colors, shorter periods

### **Event Phases**
- **⏰ Countdown**: Shows time until event starts
- **🔥 Happening**: Event is occurring now (1min window)
- **📊 Cooldown**: Event impact still relevant

### **Status Badges**
- **NEXT**: Upcoming event indicator
- **LIVE**: Currently happening event
- **Past**: Event that has occurred

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Services Used**
- **NewsService**: Template and instance management
- **CountdownService**: Time calculations
- **EventService**: Integration with existing events

### **Data Models**
```typescript
NewsTemplate: Reusable event definitions
NewsInstance: Specific scheduled occurrences  
ActiveEvent: Currently relevant events
UpcomingEvent: Future events in queue
```

### **Integration Points**
- **Settings Panel**: NewsSettings component
- **Event Display**: Enhanced event cards with news-specific styling
- **Timeline**: Integrated with existing killzones and macros
- **Status System**: Point-in-time vs interval event handling

## 🎉 **Benefits**

✅ **Realistic News Handling**: News events are point-in-time, not intervals
✅ **Template Reusability**: Create NFP instances for multiple months  
✅ **Flexible Scheduling**: Any date/time, custom overrides
✅ **Impact-Based Display**: Visual priority system
