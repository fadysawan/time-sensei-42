## Security Vulnerabilities

### Current Known Issues

#### esbuild Vulnerability (Moderate Severity)
- **Package**: esbuild <=0.24.2
- **Severity**: Moderate
- **Description**: esbuild enables any website to send any requests to the development server and read the response
- **Reference**: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99
- **Affected**: Development environment only (Vite build tool)
- **Impact**: Does not affect production builds or deployed application

### Mitigation Status

#### Development Environment
- The esbuild vulnerability only affects the development server
- Production builds are not affected by this vulnerability
- The vulnerability is in the development toolchain, not the application code

#### Production Deployment
- Production builds are safe and not affected by the esbuild vulnerability
- The application runs in production without the vulnerable development dependencies
- GitHub Pages deployment uses production builds only

### Resolution Plan

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Document the issue** - This file serves as documentation
2. **Monitor for updates** - Watch for Vite updates that include patched esbuild
3. **Production safety** - Ensure production builds remain unaffected

#### Long-term Resolution
1. **Update Node.js** - Current version (18.16.1) is below recommended minimum (18.18.0)
2. **Update Vite** - Upgrade to Vite 6.1.7+ or 7.x when Node.js is updated
3. **Update dependencies** - Resolve all npm audit issues when environment allows

### Environment Constraints

#### Current Limitations
- **Node.js Version**: 18.16.1 (below recommended 18.18.0+)
- **Permission Issues**: Local npm operations blocked by system permissions
- **Package Conflicts**: Some packages require newer Node.js versions

#### Recommended Actions
1. **Update Node.js** to version 18.18.0 or higher
2. **Run as Administrator** to resolve permission issues
3. **Update all dependencies** after Node.js upgrade

### Security Best Practices

#### Development
- Use production builds for testing when possible
- Avoid running development server on public networks
- Keep development dependencies isolated from production

#### Production
- Only deploy production builds
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Regular security audits
